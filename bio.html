    <h1>Zoe Monosson</h1>
    <p>I am a Human Factors Engineering major at Tufts University who
      believes that art and engineering walk hand in hand. This belief
      erupted from my passion for design, specifically user centered design.
      Making and creating is the core of my being, especially chair design
      and carpentry. This was further confirmed after I spent last
      semester in Copenhagen, Denmark, designing chairs and learning about
      Scandinavian Design.

      My main field of work is in usability testing, but I am also 
      intersted in graphic design and computer science. As well, I have been
      exploring the intersection of the two in UI design and computer 
      interface design. Most recently, I designed the interface for an iPad
      that would in theory be used to accompany university campus tours.

      I love folding chocolate wrappers into origami hats, artichokes, and
      being more competitive when playing card games than sports.
