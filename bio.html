    <h1>Zoe Monosson</h1>
    <p>I am a Human Factors Engineering major at Tufts University who
      believes that art and engineering walk hand in hand. This belief
      erupted from my passion for design, specifically user centered design.
      <br/>

      Making and creating is the core of my being, especially chair design
      and carpentry. This was further confirmed after I spent last
      semester in Copenhagen, Denmark, designing chairs and learning about
      Scandinavian Design.
      <br/>

      I love folding chocolate wrappers into origami hats, artichokes, and
      being more competitive when playing card games than sports.
